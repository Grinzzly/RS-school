### Description

Solution for task which was to implement `GuessingGame` class

#### Methods:

##### `setRange(min, max)`

##### `guess()`
this method returns solution candidate (you make an assumption based on range and previous assumptions)

##### `lower()`

##### `greater()`
this method is called if prev call of `guess()` returned number which is lower than answer
